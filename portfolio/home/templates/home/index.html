      <p>I'm <b>Juan</b>, a software developer with a background in telecommunications 
        and a future focused on building versatile tech solutions. 
        My experience in telecommunications sparked my interest in software and coding,
         and I've since dedicated myself to this new path. <br></p>

      <p>In order to build a well-rounded skill set, I'm currently creating a variety of personal
         projects that allow me to explore different technologies and disciplines. While
          my passion lies in <b>backend development</b> and working with <b>databases</b>, I am actively
           working on building a comprehensive <b>Full-Stack</b> skill set. This website serves as
            a live portfolio to document my progress and showcase the projects I'm building
             on my way to becoming an <b>all-around developer</b>.</p>
